# pyFloribotVision #

This student research project is designed to be a part of the [FloribotProject](http://floribot.de/ "FloribotProject").
Admittedly the stand-alone ability should be given.

The main goal is an high-grade configurable vision system. The vision process is described through configuration files
whose sections are mapped to modules/plugins where the functionality is implied.
