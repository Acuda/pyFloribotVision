General
~~~~~~~

This student research project is designed to be a part of the FloribotProject (http://floribot.de/).
Admittedly the stand-alone ability should be given.

The main goal is an high-grade configurable vision system. The vision process is described through configuration files
whose sections are mapped to modules/plugins where the functionality is implied.

Advance notice 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is in an early state. It's not recommended to use it due to the possibility of drastic changes. Furthermore
there is no documentation of the project until now.
